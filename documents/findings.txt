A broad spectrum of MLOps problems are discussed by practitioners, which
can be grouped into a hierarchical taxonomy of 5 categories and 19 topics£º
- Data: Data preparation, Data processing, Data management.
- Model: Model design, Model training,  Model monitoring, Model management.
- Component: Pipeline,Dependency,Resource.
- Environment:  Service, Endpoint,Notebook,Installation, Configuration,Execution.
- Support: Documentation,Connection,Authorization

Below are detailed description of each categegory and corresponding topics.
(1)Data: Data is a crucial component in the MLOps, which refers to the set of observations or measurements that can be used to train an ML model. This category includes two topics: Data preparation (D.1) and Data processing (D.2). D.1 topic involves loading, reading, and converting the data to make it suitable for further processing.D.2 topic focuses on specific data processing operations.Data management (D.3), is related to the Data category. This topic mainly discusses the problems related to outdated file, repository checkout, and .gitignore setting.
(2)Model£ºModel is the core element of MLOps-based applications, which can be trained to recognize patterns in datasets. This category is the biggest category based on the number of posts and include the topics of models¡¯ design, training, monitoring, and management. Specifically, Model design (M.1) includes the theoretical discussion of ML experiment design. The Model training (M.2) topic includes discussions about issues when training the ML model. Model monitoring (M.3) topic contains discussions related to metric monitoring, logging, and dashboard, etc.Model management (M.4) topic includes problems related to model deployment, model hosting, and model registering.
(3)Component: In MLOps, ML model is not independent but is part of a wider software system and depends on many components such as pipelines, dependencies, and resources.Practitioners¡¯ problems in the Pipeline (C.1) topic include pipeline scheduling and triggering. Dependency (C.2) topic includes problems related to install error, compatible issue, and conflict issue.Resource (C.3) topic consists of hardware resource management problems during MLOps.
(4)Environment: MLOps tool/platform providers usually supply fully integrated development/deployment operators for ML models, which are encapsulated as development service, deployment endpoint, and interactive notebook. The Service (E.1) topic mainly refers to MLOps service environments, which provides cloud service environment for accelerating and managing the ML
project development lifecycle.The Endpoint (E.2) topic contains discussions related to endpoint¡¯s creation, exception, and calling. Problems in the Notebook (E.3) topic are related to notebook¡¯s uploading, starting, and version controlling.Platform installation (E.4) topic includes problems when practitioners install MLOps platforms/tools.Platform configuration (E.5) topic contains issues arising from the configuration of the MLOps platform/tool itself. Platform execution (E.6) topic focuses on issues that arise while running the MLOps platform or tool.
(5)Support: Support is the elements that are ancillary to the MLOps implementation. This category discusses problems related to documentation, connection, and authorization. The Documentation (S.1) topic contains discussions related to the documentation support of MLOps tools/platforms.
The Connection (S.2) topic¡¯s discussions are related to remotely connection such as cluster connection, virtual machine connection, and IP address problem. The Authorization (S.3) topic includes discussions related to the credentials, token, permissions, and role management.
